          Variables
1.Variable: A variable is a container which is used to store values for further reference
2.General Ways to define a variable?
   	There are three ways to define a variable they are
   	1.declaration: Adding a label to the container
   	2.Assignment: Adding a value to the container
   	3.Initilization: Both declaration and Assignment at a time
3.Examples of variable:
       	Var a;
        	a=10
        	var a=10;
4.Defining a variable in python?
         	Python do not require Declaration and Assignment steps seperately it directly 
         	use initialization to define a variable
5. Syntax to define a variable
             	Variable name = value
              	Example a = 10
6.variable conditions
·       Variable can start with Alphabets or underscores
·       Variables cannot start with numbers
·       Variables can start with Alphanumeric or underscores
·       Variables are case sensitive
7.Naming conditions
    	There are two types of naming conditions they are
        	1.snake case
        	2.camel case
      	Snake case : if there is underscore between two words then it is snake case
Camel case: if there second word start with upper case letter out of two words
                          	then it is camel case
8.Multiple Assignments
a, b, c=1,2,3
a=1, b=2, c=3
	a=b=c=10
a=10, b=10, c=10
9.output statements
	Print() à predefined method à prints value
	g=1220
              h=399
	          print(g) ào/p:1220
	          print(h) ào/p:399
	          print(h,g) ào/p:399,1220
   	id() à predefined method àprints unique Address àstored in different container
  	id(g)à2307159126416
  	id(h)à2307159126448
  	print(id(h),id(g))à stored in different container
 10.Interning
           Interning will apply memory pooling
 	Example: if a=10
                       	b=10
                       	print(id(a), id(b))ào/p: stores in same container
because both a and b have same value so those values also ranges from -5 to 256 so both are stored in same container
11.reference count: The reference count for each container is 1 until the interning concept is applied
