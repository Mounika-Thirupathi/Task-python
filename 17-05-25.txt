1.What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.
Instead of owning physical hardware or data centers, organizations and individuals can access computing resources on-demand from cloud service providers and pay only for what they use.

2.Characteristics of Cloud Computing
On-Demand Self-Service: Users can access resources whenever they need them, without human intervention from the service provider

Broad Network Access: Services are accessible over the internet from various devices like laptops, mobiles, and tablets.

Resource Pooling: Providers serve multiple customers using shared resources while maintaining data security.

Rapid Elasticity: Resources can scale up or down automatically based on demand.

Measured Service: Usage is monitored, controlled, and reported, ensuring transparency between provider and consumer.


 3.Service Models in Cloud Computing
 Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
 Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.
 Example: Amazon EC2, Microsoft Azure VM

 4.Platform as a Service (PaaS)
 Provides hardware and software tools over the internet. Developers can build, test, and deploy applications without managing infrastructure.
 Example: Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure App Services

 5.Software as a Service (SaaS)
 Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis.
 Example: Google Workspace, Microsoft Office 365

6.Deployment Models in Cloud Computing
 Public Cloud
 Resources are owned and operated by third-party providers and delivered over the internet.
 Example: Amazon Web Services (AWS)

 7.Private Cloud
 Cloud infrastructure is dedicated to a single organization, either on-premises or hosted by a third-party.

 8.Hybrid Cloud
 A combination of public and private clouds, enabling data and applications to be shared between them.

 9.Community Cloud
 Infrastructure shared by several organizations with common concerns (security, compliance).

 10.Advantages of Cloud Computing
 Cost-Effective: No need to invest in expensive hardware or infrastructure.

Scalability: Easily scale resources up or down based on requirements.

Reliability: Provides data backup, disaster recovery, and high availability.

Accessibility: Access services and data from anywhere via the internet.

Automatic Updates: Cloud providers handle system maintenance and upgrades.
